    /*
    The Composite Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows you to compose objects into tree
    structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. It lets clients treat individual objects and compositions
    of objects uniformly. In essence, the Composite Pattern creates a hierarchical structure of objects, where
    individual objects and composite objects (collections of objects) are treated the same way.

    Key components of the Composite Pattern:
    Component: This is the common interface or abstract class that declares methods for all objects in the composition,
    whether they are leaf objects or composite objects. It defines the interface for adding, removing, and accessing child components.
    Leaf: This represents individual objects that do not have children. Leaf objects implement the Component interface
         and provide the actual behavior.
    Composite: This is a class that represents a collection of child components. It implements the Component interface
               as well but also contains a collection of child components. Composite objects delegate the operations
               to their child components.

    The primary benefits of using the Composite Pattern are:
